            This Python program calculates the average marks and assigns a grade based on the USIU grading system.
          </p>
          <h2>USIU Grading System</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>90 - 100: A</li>
            <li>70 - 89: B</li>
            <li>65 - 69: C</li>
            <li>50 - 64: D</li>
            <li>0 - 49: F</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Functionalities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Calculates grade based on average marks.</li>
            <li>Handles invalid marks inputs.</li>
            <li>Allows termination of the program.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Usage</h2>
          <p>
            The program prompts the user to enter marks for subjects, calculates the average, determines the grade,
            and
            offers the option to terminate.
          </p>
          <h2>Sample Output</h2>
          <p>
            Average marks: 75.50<br>

          This Prolog program represents a family tree with facts and rules defining relationships between family
          members.
          It utilizes Prolog's logic-based programming paradigm to query and infer family relationships.
        </p>
        <h2>Facts About the Family</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>John is the parent of Alice and Bob.</li>
          <li>Alice is the parent of Charlie.</li>
          <li>Bob is the parent of David.</li>

      This code includes implementations of a shape area calculator in Python, Java, and C#. Each program calculates
      the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle based on user input.
    </p>
    <h2>Python Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The Python implementation uses functions to calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle, and a
      main function to handle user input and display the results.
    </p>
    <h2>Java Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The Java implementation utilizes static methods to calculate the area of shapes and a Scanner object to
      receive user input. It then displays the calculated area.
    </p>
    <h2>C# Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The C# implementation defines static methods to compute shape areas and uses Console.ReadLine() to get user
      input and display the results.
